### Problem and Research Questions
For this project, I have been asked to work with Frito Lay on analyzing data related to employee attrition. We were also asked to examine the variables that predict employee salary.  I was provided data from 870 employees, and the dataset included 36 variables.  Data analysis for this project was done using RStudio.
